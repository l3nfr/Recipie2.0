        <h1>Shahi Paneer Recipie</h1>
        <h2 class="aboutpaneer">About</h2>
        <p class="aboutpaneer">It is a classical North Indian rich and creamy curry recipe prepared with a combination of dry fruits with onion sauce and paneer cubes. In Shahi Paneer, the word ‘Shahi’ literally means royal in Hindi, and the reference is attached mainly because of its rich and luxurious profile. It is also believed that the recipe and the gravy sauce were first introduced during the Mughal empires and served to the royal family. Hence, it carries the name and serves it on auspicious and religious occasions. 
        A simple and creamy Shahi Paneer Masala Recipe is prepared in many ways. The most common way is to make it with a combination of nuts like almonds, cashews, and walnuts and diced onions. The tomato is skipped as it does not yield a rich colour, however in some variation, even tomatoes are added. Adding tomatoes will change their colour and texture, and it is typically added in dhaba-style recipes. Further, the curry can also be used as a multi-purpose sauce and other vegetables and meat tenders can be added to the same sauce.</p>
